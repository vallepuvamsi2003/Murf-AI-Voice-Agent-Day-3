Today’s build was all about empathy, consistency, and meaningful interaction. I created a daily wellness-focused voice agent that checks in like a supportive companion—without trying to be a clinician.

💡 What the Agent Does

✅ Conducts short daily voice check-ins

 ✅ Asks about mood, energy, and stress levels

 ✅ Helps users set 1–3 realistic goals for the day

 ✅ Offers simple, actionable, non-medical suggestions

 ✅ Recaps the conversation to reinforce clarity & intention

🧠 Memory + Personalization

Every session is logged into a wellness_log.json file that stores:

Timestamp

Reported mood

Daily objectives

A short summary

When the user returns, the agent references past check-ins—e.g.,

 “Yesterday you mentioned low energy—how does today feel in comparison?”

This gives the interaction continuity and emotional context. 💬

🛠 Tech Highlights

Grounded system prompt for supportive, safe responses

Persistent JSON-based storage

Conversational state awareness

Smooth browser voice interaction

🌿 Why This Matters

Not everyone needs a diagnosis—sometimes they just need:

 a check-in, a nudge, a reminder to breathe, or a small goal.

This agent aims to provide exactly that—human-centered AI support.

🎥 I’ll be sharing a short demo video soon, including the JSON log in action!
